# lyra — dexterous humanoid hand concept

An aesthetically refined five-digit robotic RIGHT hand for an advanced
bipedal robot: slim pearl-composite shell tubes over an exposed graphite
structural spine, machined-aluminum precision knuckle clevises with visible
pivot pins and rim washers, tendon-driven architecture (dorsal tendon
channel grooves fanning to each knuckle plus a five-dial tensioner row at
the wrist), integrated tactile sensing (2x2 palm pad array, per-phalanx
soft-touch strips, palmar fingertip caps, amber-ringed palm sensor), and a
6-bolt wrist flange. Graceful human-like proportions (~198 mm flange to
middle fingertip), clean industrial design, no logos.

## Degrees of freedom (16)

| Group | Joints | DOF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Each finger (x4) | MCP, PIP, DIP flexion (about -X) | 12 |
| Thumb | CMC yaw (opposition swing about +Z), CMC flex, MP, IP (about -Y) | 4 |

MCP abduction/spread is intentionally omitted (documented tendon-budget
trade in `lyra_parts/chain.py`). Named poses are FK-tuned: `precision_pinch`
closes the thumb-index pads to ~2.6 mm, `tripod_pinch` chuck-grips a
virtual ~15 mm object, and the `fist` thumb wraps onto the index middle
phalanx.

## Files

- `lyra.py` — build123d generator (`gen_step()`); authoritative source.
  Joints are authored as `cadpy.assembly.AssemblyHelper` revolute frames
  driven by the baked `relaxed` pose. Also exposes `gen_urdf()` /
  `gen_srdf()` for the robot description.
- `lyra_parts/` — part-builder package. `chain.py` is the shared kinematic
  chain/pose/limit spec (stdlib-only FK included) used by the CAD assembly,
  the URDF/SRDF generators, and the animation sidecar; `lib.py` holds the
  palette and the verified `revolute_attach()` joint math; `palm.py` /
  `digits.py` build the parts; `description.py` emits the URDF/SRDF XML;
  `mass_props.py` holds baked CAD volume/COM/inertia/bbox data.
- `lyra.step` — generated STEP assembly (derived artifact), baked in the
  `relaxed` pose. Occurrence refs `#o1.1..#o1.17` follow the `asm.add`
  order in `lyra.py` (palm, then index/middle/ring/pinky
  proximal/middle/distal, then thumb base/metacarpal/proximal/distal).
- `.lyra.step.js` — CAD Viewer animation sidecar driving per-frame chain FK
  deltas against the baked pose. Animations: `poseTour` (relaxed ->
  precision pinch -> tripod pinch -> point -> OK sign -> fist), `graspLoop`
  (power grasp), `pinchLoop` (pinch with pad double-tap), `rippleLoop`
  (traveling finger curl wave), `countLoop` (count to five from a fist).
  Controls: `phase`, `mode`, `pose` (named SRDF pose hold), `grip`.
- `lyra.urdf` — generated URDF (derived artifact): a frame-only
  `wrist_mount` root plus 17 physical links and 16 revolute joints,
  per-link 3MF mesh visuals, bbox collisions, CAD-derived inertials at an
  assumed 0.62 kg total mass.
- `lyra.srdf` — generated MoveIt2 SRDF (derived artifact): per-digit joint
  groups, `fingers`/`hand` unions, a palm-mounted `hand_eef` end effector,
  disabled collisions, and hand group states (`zero`, `relaxed`, `fist`,
  `precision_pinch`, `tripod_pinch`, `point`, `ok_sign`).
- `STEP/` — per-link wrapper sources (`gen_step()` per link) and their
  generated STEP parts; `3MF/` — per-link mm mesh sidecars referenced by
  the URDF.

## Conventions

Units mm. RIGHT hand: the wrist-flange mount face center is the origin,
+Z distal (fingers up), +Y palmar, +X radial (thumb side). Every link frame
sits at its joint center with axes parallel to the palm at zero angles
(URDF joints are pure translations). Positive joint angles flex/curl.
