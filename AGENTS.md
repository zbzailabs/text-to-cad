# AGENTS.md

This repo is a workbench for CAD-related agent skills. Treat `skills/` as the
product and `models/` as the shared fixture/artifact area.

## Branch And Layout First

Before changing code, branch from `develop`, not `main`; PRs should target `develop`.
Do not start development work from `main`. The `develop` branch intentionally uses
symlinks across generated runtime, viewer-local package, and plugin package
paths. When a path is symlinked, follow the link and edit the source target.
Use `main` as the production clone/release branch only. `main` is publish-only:
do not open PRs to `main` or push it directly.

## Release Workflow

Normal development work targets `develop` and should not bump the canonical release
version in `plugins/cad/VERSION`. To start a release, run the `Prepare Release`
workflow with `base_branch=develop`; it creates a `release/<version>` branch,
updates only `plugins/cad/VERSION`, and opens a PR back to `develop`. The `Test`
workflow runs a production bundle job on `develop` and PRs to `develop`, so
production-output issues are caught before publishing. After a release PR
merges, `Publish` is run manually with `source_ref=develop` and ships only when
the source version is newer than `main` and the latest semver tag; it stamps
duplicate package/plugin metadata from `plugins/cad/VERSION`, bundles real
generated outputs, validates and tests that production layout, writes the
publish commit to `main`, creates the semver git tag, and opens a draft GitHub
Release. Use `target_branch=main` only for a real release and
`target_branch=build-test` for publish rehearsals. Pushing `develop` runs tests
but does not publish `main`.
Use `scripts/release/bump-version.sh` and
`scripts/release/publish-github-release.sh` only as local/manual fallbacks for
the GitHub workflows.

## Repo Map

- `skills/`: agent skills and their references/scripts.
- `plugins/`: versioned agent plugin packages that bundle repo skills.
- `models/`: sample and durable CAD/robot-description fixtures.
- `viewer/`: editable CAD Viewer source app.
- `packages/`: shared source packages copied or vendored into consuming
  runtimes.
- `docs/`: documentation site.
- `tests/`: repo-wide policy tests that are not owned by one package, skill, or
  app runtime.
- `scripts/`: durable repo commands grouped by purpose.

## Repo Rules

- Keep root guidance short. Put domain workflows, CLI details, and validation
  policy in the relevant `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` or `references/` file.
- Keep relevant Markdown docs current when changing behavior, commands, or repo
  layout, but do not bloat `AGENTS.md`; use it only for durable repo-level
  rules and pointers.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before committing, rebasing, resolving generated-file
  conflicts, or bumping release versions.
- Keep the `develop` checkout in symlink layout with
  `scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh`.
- Each skill must be self-contained and independent at runtime. A skill must
  not refer to or import or depend on code from another skill, from `skills/`
  root, or from repository-root modules. Do not add `skills/`, the repository
  root, or sibling skill directories to `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, `NODE_PATH`,
  or similar runtime lookup paths. Shared runtime helpers must live under
  `packages/` as the source of truth and be vendored/generated from there into
  each consuming skill runtime; do not keep shared helper modules directly under
  `skills/`.
- Edit the source reached by the `develop` symlink layout first, then regenerate
  explicit derived outputs when a production-output task requires it.
- Write all test, sample, permanent, and generated CAD/robot-description
  artifacts under `models/`, including STEP/STP, STL, GLB, DXF, URDF, SRDF,
  SDF, and G-code outputs. Do not create ad hoc artifact directories elsewhere.
- Reserve `scripts/` for durable repo commands. Do not write temporary,
  one-off, or local-only helper scripts there; use `tmp/` or `/tmp` instead.
- Development symlinks mark generated or copied paths. If a file is under a
  symlinked runtime, viewer package, or plugin package path, edit the symlink
  target/source path instead of treating the copy as independent.
- When source changes affect generated runtimes or plugin packages, refresh or
  check them with the master bundle wrapper, `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`. Use
  lower-level bundle scripts only when debugging the wrapper itself.
- `packages/cadjs` must stay reusable/non-React; app UI and workflow state
  belong in `viewer/`.
- `packages/cadpy` owns reusable Python artifact generation; skills should use
  bundled package code, not sibling skill imports.
- Create lightweight shared Python packages under `packages/cadpy_*` when a
  helper should not inherit heavier package dependencies.
- Use path-targeted search, validation, and `git status`; avoid broad scans over
  generated CAD/LFS artifacts unless the task requires them.
- Treat `plugins/cad/VERSION` as the canonical release version. Do not hand-edit
  duplicate package, plugin, lockfile, or Python `pyproject.toml` versions;
  `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh` stamps them from the canonical version during
  production bundling.

## Environments

- Prefer `./.venv/bin/python` for CAD Python work.
- Install dependencies only for the workflow being changed.
- Do not commit `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, caches, `tmp/`, local credentials, or
  printer config.

## Checks

Run the smallest path-targeted check that covers the change. Use broad wrappers
when touching shared surfaces or before handoff:

- Code tests: `scripts/test/test.sh`
  - In GitHub Actions, `test.yml` checks the canonical release version as a
    separate non-blocking job, verifies the `develop` symlink layout on `develop`,
    and runs a temporary production bundle check plus docs checks for `develop`.
    `main` writes are validated by `publish.yml`; GitHub branch settings should
    block PRs and direct pushes to `main`.
- Focused test runners: `scripts/test/test-js.sh`,
  `scripts/test/test-docs.sh`, `scripts/test/test-python.sh`,
  `scripts/test/test-global.sh`
- Development symlink layout: `scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh --check`
- Canonical release version: `scripts/release/check-version.sh`
- Generated runtime and plugin freshness: `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check`
- CAD Viewer or `packages/cadjs`: `npm --prefix packages/cadjs test`,
  `npm --prefix viewer run test`, `npm --prefix viewer run build`
- Docs site: `npm --prefix docs run check`
- Targeted Python tests: `./.venv/bin/python -m unittest <changed test paths>`

When a task intentionally writes production outputs locally, run
`scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`, rerun `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check`, and restore
the development symlink layout afterward if you are continuing on `develop`.

## CAD Viewer

When reviewing repo fixtures in CAD Viewer, point the Viewer at the repo
`models/` directory with an absolute `?dir=` path; keep any permanent or
generated CAD/robot-description files in `models/` so the viewer catalog and
artifacts stay in one place.

For root dev-server iteration, use the URL printed by Viewer commands; do not
assume a fixed dev port unless you pass Vite's standard `--port` flag.

When modifying Viewer behavior, always run the root source app in dev mode for
iteration; do not run the generated viewer from the cad-viewer skill while
developing.

```bash
npm --prefix viewer run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Packaged Viewer runtime and handoff details belong in the `cad-viewer` skill
instructions. Treat packaged Viewer checks as generated-output checks and use
the master bundle wrapper unless you are debugging a lower-level script.

## Git And LFS

CAD exchange files, generated render/topology assets, `assets/**`, and
`benchmarks/**` may be LFS-tracked. Never disable LFS filters for `git add`,
commits, or other object-writing operations. Local hooks live in `.githooks` and
delegate build checks through `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`.
